# Autonomous-electric-car-ride-hailing-simulation
This project simulated operations of ride-hailing and ride-sharing services using autonomous and electric vehicles (EAV).

Proposed 2 EAV taxi dispatch models: the optimization dispatch model, and the neural network dispatch model.

First, run simulation using the optimization dispatch model and generate the optimal dispatch data. Second, use the optimal dispatch data to train the neural network dispatch model. The neural network model can learn the optimal dispatch solutions, and also is much faster to obtain dispatch solutions than solving a integer programming problem.
